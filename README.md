# check-website-status
i wrote a application with the python that sends the request to the a valid link and gets a respond (404 or 200 or 300 etc...) and notice the user if the host or the website is available or not !

you may ask what is the purpose of this project...
i use this for my own websites to be sure they are doing fine.
and you can even use it on your linux network beacuse the linux apache 2 uses the request & respond logic too

i didnt work on gui of the project i hope if you improve the project send me the code :)
