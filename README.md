# check-website-status
I wrote an application in Python that sends a request to a valid link and gets a response (404, 200, 300, etc.). It notifies the user if the host or website is available or not.

You may ask, what is the purpose of this project? I use it for my own websites to ensure they are functioning properly. You can even use it on your Linux network because Linux Apache 2 uses the request and response logic too.

I havenâ€™t worked on the GUI of the project. I hope if you improve the project, you can send me the code. :)
